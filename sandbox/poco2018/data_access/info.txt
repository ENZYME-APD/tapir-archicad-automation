Attached is a AddOn -data_access.apx - which I  have used myself to extend the Python API through the Commandhandler functions
The addon is compiled for Windows Only but I have also included the source. 
Note that most of the functions have just been copied from the Grafhisoft examples. 
The docx file explains the usage. The source must be cleaned up as it contains a lot of commented out false starts and 
debug info. I did not do so as the functions may not be acceptable -- so pointless to do so now.
I did not include any associated grasshopper Python components for the functions since I am not at that stage.
I  include here just for comment and testing if anyone is interested. Use with coution.
Perhaps some code may be helpful to be included in TaPir's AddOn?? 
Interested in any other suggestions and if this type thing is of any value to anyone?
